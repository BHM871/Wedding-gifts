<h1 align="center">Wedding Gifts API</h1>

<h3 align="center">This project is for gift management, in which, the gifts will not be essential, only the value, so that the gift-givers send only the money and do not have to buy the gifts.</h3>

<p>The project uses Clean Architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security with JWT, PostgreSQL, etc. Microservices with API will also be implemented for creating PIX, sending email, documentation with Swagger, etc.</p>

<h3 align="center"> :warning: I'm currently mapping the exceptions, and then adding the HandlerException, then I'll start the documentation with Swagger. :warning: </h3>
